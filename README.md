Hi my name is Jordi Simbana. I'm 15 years old and I currently attend the Highschool of Telecommunications Arts and Technology. 

I enjoy learning about cameras and anything related to production (camera operating, editing, sound engineering, etc.). I am currently serving at my local church (Resurrection Church) 
doing behind the scenes work on the online services. I really enjoy doing it and I hope to get better as I grow more.
